I was hopting that this would be more difficult, it wasnt. The flipper can just read + emulate the Tags. 
They are EM - Micro EM4100 Tags. Industrial standart ones,

Since that was so easy and could not really be called research I looked into some other ways to missuse this thing.

- maybe power analyis ? 
- generating abitrary keys with the flipper
- extending range of original tag?
